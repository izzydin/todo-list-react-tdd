# React TypeScript Todo List

A professional-grade Todo List application built to demonstrate modern frontend engineering practices, strictly following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project showcases a production-ready setup for a React application. It focuses on:
- **Correctness**: Validated through rigorous testing (Vitest, RTL).
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture and strict TypeScript typing.
- **Performance**: Powered by Vite for instant feedback loops.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: React 18, TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, jest-dom
- **Styling**: CSS Modules / Vanilla CSS (Modern Features)
- **Package Manager**: NPM

## 👨‍💻 Development Principles

We adhere to strict engineering standards:

1.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
    - 🔴 **Red**: Write a failing test for a small unit of functionality.
    - 🟢 **Green**: Write the minimal code to pass the test.
    - 🔵 **Refactor**: Improve code quality while ensuring tests pass.

2.  **Conventional Commits**:
    - git commit messages follow the `type(scope): description` format.

3.  **Minimalism**:
    - No over-engineering.
    - Code exists only to satisfy requirements and tests.
